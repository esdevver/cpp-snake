Note: I was just getting back into C++. Do not use this code for "best practises" in terms of syntax or terminal I/O I just wanted to publish this

# Setup
I was able to compile this with g++.

If you have Makefile and g++, `make` should work in most environments. Any problems you'd probably be able to solve yourself. Otherwise post an issue.

`make` builds then runs

`make build` compiles it

`make clean` gets rid of the bin directory

`make run` starts the game (make sure to build first)
